          My Journey & Vision
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-indigo-900 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          My journey into technology is deeply rooted in my experience as an educator. I&apos;ve seen firsthand the challenges and opportunities at the intersection of teaching and technology. This unique perspective drives my approach: to build solutions that are not just innovative, but also practical, intuitive, and truly serve the needs of teachers and students. My passion lies in leveraging data and artificial intelligence to streamline administrative tasks for educators, providing them with valuable insights that free up their time to focus on what matters most â€“ building meaningful relationships with their students.

        <p className="text-lg text-indigo-900 leading-relaxed">
          I believe that technology should be a powerful assistant, not a replacement, in the learning environment. My goal is to bridge the gap between academic research and real-world classroom application, creating tools that make a tangible difference in learning experiences.
